The Challenge of Exercise Motivation

The saying "easier said than done" could've been written about exercise. We know it's good for us, but the trick is getting started and staying consistent when motivation dips. The quickest way through that wall? Find a reason that matters to you, then make movement small, simple, and regular.

Core Principle: Finding your personal reason — your "why" — can make all the difference. This is what keeps you lacing up your shoes on the days you'd rather not. When motivation dips, having a clear reason can make all the difference.

Motivation Hacks and Strategies

Start Small — Really Small:
- Starting is the hardest part
- Running a marathon, losing 30 pounds or getting six-pack abs are impressive goals, but it can take a lot of work to stay focused on achievements that may be months or even years in the making
- Instead, set short-term goals you can hit this week
- Example progression: 3 × 15-minute sessions, four days per week for the second month and five days per week for the third month
- It's easy to feel like you're failing and quit when goals are too big
- Only have a few minutes? Try the 3-minute Low-Motivation Reset workout

Use the Power of Routine:
- Doing anything consistently turns actions into norms in your life
- You develop pathways in the brain that reinforce repeating the behaviour, so it becomes an action you do with little effort
- Start with something easy, like a 15-minute walk three times a week
- When you get mastery over that routine, challenge yourself a bit more
- Consistency builds neural pathways that make the behavior automatic

Find an Activity You Enjoy:
- Gyms are designed and equipped for exercise, so if that motivates you to get active, keep doing what you're doing
- For guys who prefer to exercise elsewhere, there is no shortage of indoor and outdoor activities that combine physical activity with enjoyment
- Examples: cycling, hiking, pickleball, baseball, or horseshoes
- Anything that gets you outside and moving your body will do
- If you're pressed for time, try a 3-minute workout

Turn Up the Tunes:
- Listening to music can help you enjoy exercise more
- Research shows it can improve your athletic performance and make exercise feel easier to do
- Build a go-to playlist for "I don't feel like it" days
- Music enhances the exercise experience and can boost performance

Be Prepared:
- Fill a backpack with exercise gear and put it beside your front door
- Or put your running shoes by the bed and weights around the house where you'll see them
- You'll never be caught unprepared, and it'll remind you to get moving
- Think of it as a "trigger" for your new healthy habit
- Environmental cues can prompt action without requiring motivation

Make it Social:
- Trade pub hangouts for evening hikes, bike rides, or runs
- According to research from the University of Pennsylvania, sweating it out with a friend can lead to more weight loss than going solo
- Not only is it motivating to have a workout buddy, but it also helps to hold you accountable
- Working out with a group of people–even if you don't know them (yet)–is a great way to get your body moving while expanding your social circle
- Social support increases adherence and results

Set a Schedule and Stick to It:
- Schedule time for getting active in your calendar and treat it as a non-negotiable commitment, much like a medical appointment or meeting with co-workers
- If you had planned to exercise outdoors and it gets cancelled due to bad weather, you've already set the time aside, so you can easily pivot and do your workout indoors
- Treating exercise as an appointment increases follow-through

Make Technology Work for You:
- Use your phone's step counter or a simple habit tracker
- Nudge goals up slowly as streaks build
- Technology can provide accountability and motivation through tracking
- Fitness apps offer structured programs and progress monitoring

Finding Your Personal "Why"

Figuring out why movement matters to you is what keeps you lacing up your shoes on the days you'd rather not. Here are some common motivators and how exercise helps you get there:

To Feel Better — Mentally and Emotionally:
- As a mental health counsellor perspective: sweating it out — especially outdoors — can ease stress, calm your mind, and disrupt negative thought patterns
- Hitting exercise goals boosts confidence and self-esteem
- Exercise serves as an effective tool for mental health management
- Outdoor exercise provides additional benefits for mood and stress reduction

To Sleep Better and Wake Up Feeling Refreshed:
- Regular physical activity improves sleep duration and quality
- Helps you fall asleep faster
- Important note: avoid hard workouts right before bed
- Better sleep leads to improved energy and overall well-being

To Sharpen Your Focus and Perform Better at Work:
- Problem-solving, memory, and concentration all improve following physical activity because of a chemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
- There's evidence that parts of the brain grow as people get fitter, which delivers longer-term brain benefits
- People who regularly get active have been proven to be more productive at work, think more creatively, and are less likely to make mistakes than those who aren't active
- Exercise enhances cognitive function and workplace performance

To Keep Up With Your Kids (and Life):
- Exercise improves cardiovascular endurance and stamina
- Helps with everything from healing injuries to fighting colds by contributing to a healthy immune system and reducing inflammation
- Moving your body increases mood and energy-boosting neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine
- Physical fitness enables you to fully participate in life activities

To Enjoy Better Sex:
- Extra energy and looking and feeling good all support bedroom bliss
- Exercise has been shown to boost the body's production of the hormone testosterone, which fuels the male sex drive
- Physical fitness contributes to sexual health and satisfaction

To Protect Your Health and Live Longer:
- Exercise reduces the risk and severity of heart disease, some forms of cancer, arthritis, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and muscle and bone injuries
- Regular physical activity is a key component of disease prevention and longevity

Overcoming Roadblocks

Remember that roadblocks will pop up along the way. The key to overcoming them is to stay motivated by focusing on your "why." This also means being flexible and resourceful.

Flexibility Strategies:
- If you missed a gym workout because you had to pick up the kids, play road hockey with them after dinner instead
- If all you have the time or energy for is to go outside for a walk around the block, it still counts
- Don't make it hard on yourself
- It doesn't need to be all or nothing when reaping the benefits of moving more

Expert Advice from Dr. Leigh Vanderloo:
- Scientific Director of ParticipACTION
- "Something's better than nothing. More is always better."
- "You have to understand that whatever activity you're choosing to do has to work for your current life"
- "Try to find ways to overcome those particular challenges and to prioritize moving as something as a 'need to have' rather than a 'nice to have'"
- Flexibility and realistic expectations are key to long-term success

The Science Behind Exercise Motivation

Neurological Benefits:
- Consistent exercise creates neural pathways that reinforce repeating behaviors
- Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) improves cognitive function
- Brain growth occurs as people get fitter, delivering longer-term benefits
- Neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine) boost mood and energy

Social Support Research:
- University of Pennsylvania research shows exercising with a friend leads to more weight loss than going solo
- Social accountability increases adherence
- Group exercise expands social circles while improving fitness

Music and Performance:
- Research demonstrates music improves athletic performance
- Music makes exercise feel easier to do
- Playlists can be effective tools for motivation on difficult days

Practical Implementation Guide

Starting Strategies:
1. Begin with very small, achievable goals (15 minutes, 3 times per week)
2. Choose activities you genuinely enjoy
3. Set up environmental triggers (gear by door, shoes by bed)
4. Create a schedule and treat it as non-negotiable
5. Use technology for tracking and accountability

Building Consistency:
- Start with mastery of easy routines before increasing challenge
- Use the power of routine to create automatic behaviors
- Focus on your personal "why" during low motivation periods
- Maintain flexibility when life gets in the way
- Celebrate small wins and building streaks

Maintaining Long-Term Motivation:
- Regularly revisit your personal reasons for exercising
- Stay flexible and adaptable when roadblocks appear
- Remember that something is better than nothing
