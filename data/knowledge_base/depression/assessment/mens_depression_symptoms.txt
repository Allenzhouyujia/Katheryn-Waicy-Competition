Primary Symptoms

The hallmark symptoms of depression include:

Emotional Changes:
- Persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or flatness lasting more than two weeks
- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed
- Feeling hopeless, worthless, or excessively guilty
- Heightened irritability, frustration, or anger (especially common in men)

Behavioral Changes:
- Withdrawing from family, friends, and social activities
- Avoiding work, hobbies, or responsibilities
- Increased risk-taking behavior
- Changes in appetite—eating much more or much less than usual

Physical Symptoms:
- Persistent low energy or fatigue, even after rest
- Sleep disturbances—insomnia, early waking, or sleeping too much
- Unexplained aches and pains
- Slowed movements or speech

Cognitive Changes:
- Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, or making decisions
- Overly negative thinking patterns
- Thoughts becoming foggy or unclear
- Difficulty focusing at work or during conversations

Red Flag Symptoms

Critical warning signs that require immediate attention:

- Suicidal thoughts: Any thoughts of death, dying, or suicide should always be taken seriously
- Self-harm urges: Thoughts of hurting yourself
- Feeling like a burden: Believing others would be better off without you
- Hopelessness: Feeling trapped with no way out

If you experience any of these symptoms, seek help immediately:
- Call or text 988 (Suicide Crisis Helpline)
- Go to your nearest emergency department
- Call 911
- Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or healthcare provider

How Men May Uniquely Experience Depression

Men often experience depression differently and may not recognize these patterns as depression:

Anger and Aggression:
- Feeling irritable most of the time
- Quick to anger or lose your temper
- Aggressive behavior or verbal outbursts

Physical Complaints:
- Focusing on physical symptoms like chronic pain
- Frequent headaches or digestive problems
- Muscle tension or back pain

Escapist Behaviors:
- Working excessively to avoid thinking about problems
- Spending more time on sports, video games, or other activities
- Increased alcohol or substance use

Emotional Numbness:
- Feeling nothing rather than feeling sad
- Loss of emotional response to things that used to matter
- Difficulty crying even when you want to

Duration Matters

Everyone has bad days or feels down occasionally. Depression is different because:
- Symptoms persist for at least two weeks or longer
- Symptoms are present most of the day, nearly every day
- Symptoms interfere with your ability to function at work, home, or in relationships

What to Do If You Recognize These Symptoms

In yourself:
1. Take a free self-assessment (MindFit Toolkit)
2. Talk to your family doctor or healthcare provider
3. Reach out to someone you trust
4. Consider calling a mental health helpline

In someone else:
1. Start a conversation—express your concern
2. Listen without judgment
3. Encourage them to seek help
4. Offer to help them find resources or accompany them to appointments

Remember: Recognizing symptoms is the first step toward getting help. Depression is a medical condition, not something you can just "snap out of," and professional treatment is often necessary for recovery.
